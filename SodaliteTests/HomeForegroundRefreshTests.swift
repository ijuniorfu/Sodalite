/// Sodalite#117, DrHurt: Home kept showing the shelf it had loaded before the Apple TV went to
/// sleep, for any length of time, and only a force quit brought a fresh one.
///
/// The cause is a lifecycle event that does not exist. Measured with a throwaway SwiftUI app on
/// tvOS 26.5 and iOS 26.5: a background round trip delivers `scenePhase` transitions and nothing
/// else, no second `onAppear`, no `onDisappear`, no `.task` re-run. Home's only staleness gate hung
/// on `onAppear`, so a resumed app had no path to refresh at all.
///
/// The gate itself is what these pin. It now lives on the view model, because two triggers ask it
/// the same question (a return to the tab, a return of the app) and they must not drift apart.

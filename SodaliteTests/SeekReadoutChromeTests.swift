/// a trickplay frame, 56 pt in the middle of the screen when no frame has resolved. Which one a
/// viewer got was `ScrubPreviewProvider`'s answer for that position at that moment, so a burst could
/// change size and side of the track while the glyph was on screen. Round 2 moved it below the
/// track, to the knob, at the size the live rail draws it. What is pinned here is that there is one
/// size and one row, and that the card it left is no longer sized for a guest that never arrives.

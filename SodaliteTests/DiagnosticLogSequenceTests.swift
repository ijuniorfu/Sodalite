/// Audit 2026-09-25 DIAG-8. `LogTap.lines.count` pins at 300 once the ring starts evicting from the
/// front, so `DiagnosticLogView`'s `.onChange(of: tap.lines.count)` stopped firing (the view stopped
/// following new lines), and its offset-based row id shifted by one on every append, dragging
/// whatever the reader had focused along with it. `sequenceNumber` keeps climbing past the ring cap,
/// and `DiagnosticLogView.lineID` derives a per-line id from it that survives eviction.

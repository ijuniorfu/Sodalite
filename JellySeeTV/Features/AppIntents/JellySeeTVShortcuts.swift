/// Surfaces our intents to Siri and the Shortcuts app. On tvOS,
/// holding the Siri Remote button and saying any of these phrases
/// invokes the matching intent — Siri matches on the localized
/// phrase from the App Shortcuts catalog, so each language ships
/// its own variant in `AppShortcuts.xcstrings`.
///
/// **tvOS Siri limitation note:** custom AppIntents that aren't
/// based on a system schema (Open, Search, PlayMedia, etc.) are
/// rejected by tvOS Siri at voice-invocation time with a "the app
/// doesn't support this with Siri" error — even when the phrase
/// matches and the AppIntent metadata is correct. Only the
/// `OpenJellySeeTVIntent` is exposed here because "Open [App]" is
/// a system-blessed pattern that Apple handles itself via
/// LSOpenURL, not via our custom intent. `ContinueWatchingIntent`
/// stays in the codebase for the Shortcuts app on connected
/// iPhones / iPads / Macs (where custom intents do work via
/// voice), but advertising it here just produces the user-visible
/// error on tvOS Siri.

/// Authenticated, memory-cached replacement for SwiftUI's
/// `AsyncImage`. Three things the stock version can't do that we
/// need:
///
/// 1. Attach the Jellyfin access token on every request via the
///    `X-Emby-Token` header, SwiftUI's AsyncImage uses
///    URLSession.shared with no way to inject headers, so servers
///    that require auth for image endpoints (the default on modern
///    Jellyfin) silently 401 the request and leave the view on the
///    placeholder. This loader mirrors the same auth mechanism our
///    regular API calls use, so if the API works, images work too.
///
/// 2. Re-issue the load when the URL changes (profile switches
///    swap the token, which changes the URL's `api_key` query). We
///    do that with `.task(id:)` so cancellation is automatic.
///
/// 3. Keep a small in-process image cache. URLSession's shared
///    cache is disk-backed and can serve stale 401 responses
///    across app launches; ours is memory-only and survives only
///    the current session, which is exactly what we want for
///    avatar/poster thumbnails.

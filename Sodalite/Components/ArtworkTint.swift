/// hard cut (Sodalite#95). The hue is always the artwork's own. The saturation is lifted to a floor,
/// because the page has to stay dark enough for white body text and a dark colour needs a high HSB
/// saturation before the eye reads it as a colour at all: at brightness 0.24 a saturation of 0.39
/// spans 24 of 255 levels, which is a grey with a lean.
///
/// Measured over 22 backdrops (2026-08-31, the corpus behind Sodalite#95's tint note): 19 of them
/// have a chroma-weighted hue coherence of 0.55 or better, so the strip's hues do NOT cancel and the
/// average already points at the right hue. What made nearly every page read grey or brown was the
/// brightness clamp plus the fact that much graded content has a warm bottom edge (8 of the 22 sit at
/// hue 0.03 to 0.13, which is brown once it is dark). Lifting saturation is therefore the lever;
/// re-deriving the hue only rescues the few strips whose average is dragged off by grey pixels
/// (The Matrix: average saturation 0.045, chromatic saturation 0.435).
///
/// The lift is gated, because a strip with no colour in it must stay neutral. Two failure cases from
/// the same corpus: an achromatic backdrop (Arrival, chroma 0.000) has no hue to recover, and a
/// letterboxed one (The Lord of the Rings, chroma 0.000 under a black bar) reports a coherence of
/// 0.89 that is entirely JPEG noise. Both keep the plain average, which is grey, which is honest.

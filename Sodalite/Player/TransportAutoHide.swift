/// The two rules that decide whether the transport is on screen while playback is not running
/// (Sodalite#93). Both used to live inline in `PlayerViewModel` and both were wrong there.
///
/// `hides` is the auto-hide's liveness check, and its whole point is WHERE it is evaluated. The old
/// code checked `isPlaying` when it ARMED the 5s timer, inside `togglePlayPause`, one statement after
/// `player.togglePlayPause()`. That call is asynchronous and the engine's state sink is delivered on a
/// later runloop turn (`.receive(on:)`), so on the very press that paused, `isPlaying` still carried
/// `true`, the guard passed, and five seconds later a paused still frame lost its transport. Asking at
/// FIRE time is the fix; nothing about the answer itself is interesting.
///
/// `raisesTransport` covers the other half: a pause from outside the app (Siri, Control Center, or the
/// AVKit transport that co-owns the hardware play/pause button on the native path) reaches the host only
/// as an engine state change, and that path never touched control visibility at all. It raises the
/// transport now, except in the two states that would misread the flag: behind an error screen the
/// session is over and Menu has to stay "dismiss the player" rather than "close the transport", and the
/// iOS child lock deliberately cleared it. The loading spinner is NOT among them, because it and this
/// decision arrive from different publishers in no fixed order, and a raise skipped on a stale `true`
/// would never be retried.

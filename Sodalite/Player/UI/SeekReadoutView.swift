/// Sodalite#104: a press and a hold, in the two languages they actually speak.
///
/// A press names its interval, because the destination is known before it lands, and counts itself,
/// because a burst of four is the thing a viewer is keeping track of. A hold names its rate and
/// nothing else: a 15x to 240x scan has no countable step, so a fixed-interval glyph over it would be
/// a lie. Nothing draws here on the touch transport, where a skip commits on the tap that asked for
/// it and flashes its own HUD.
///
/// Both readouts stay on ONE line, beside the clock rather than over it: a column of glyph over
/// count is 66 pt against the clock's 37 on tvOS, and a stack centred on the clock's line spends the
/// difference upwards, into the gap that separates this row from a knob which is 22 pt wide exactly
/// while the readout is drawn. The burst count reads the same beside the glyph as under it.
///
/// Sodalite#151: this and `SeekTrail` are what BOTH tvOS transports draw. They lived beside the live
/// rail while the live rail was their only reader, which is how the same press came to report itself
/// in two languages depending on what was playing.

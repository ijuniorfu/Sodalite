/// Who puts the fullscreen music player on screen, and whether it should be up at all.
///
/// Sodalite#140 follow-up. A view controller can present one thing at a time, and with the sidebar
/// the whole shell is ONE hosting controller: the album detail cover and the router's player cover
/// are siblings in it, so the second presentation was refused and only went through once the album
/// cover was dismissed. That is the bug as reported, "the player only comes up after pressing back
/// once", and it never showed with the top bar because a TabView hosts each tab's content in a
/// controller of its own, which leaves the router free to present over it.
///
/// Measured in a throwaway tvOS harness (2026-09-13) with the two shells side by side: the same
/// pair of covers stacks under a TabView and is deferred under a plain HStack.
///
/// So the presenting side is chosen instead of assumed: a surface presented above the router claims
/// the player while it is on screen and hosts its own cover, the router keeps its own for everything
/// else. `ParentalGate.presenterStack` answers the same question for the PIN prompt.

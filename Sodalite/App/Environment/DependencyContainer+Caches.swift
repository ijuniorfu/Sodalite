/// Reading and dropping every cache the app keeps (Sodalite#117, DrHurt asked for a way to see it
/// and a way to clear it).
///
/// It lives here rather than in the view because the container is the only place that holds all of
/// them: the Seerr client is built in its init and reachable nowhere else, and a screen that went
/// looking for the stores itself would be a second list to keep in step with this one.
///
/// The whole set, and the reason each figure is what it is:
///
/// - The entry cache Sodalite writes itself, `FilterCache`, as JSON under `Library/Caches`. Summed
///   over its files.
/// - The response cache, `sodalite-http-cache`. The Jellyfin client and the Seerr client each build
///   a `URLCache` with that same disk path, so they are two handles on ONE directory: the figure is
///   read from one of them, because adding both would count the same bytes twice, and the clear
///   walks both, because the memory half of a URLCache belongs to its own instance. The discovery
///   client has no cache at all (`urlCache = nil`), so it is not in here and does not need to be.
/// - Artwork, `sodalite-image-cache`. The decoded images in `ImageCache` ride along when clearing
///   but carry no figure: they sit in an `NSCache`, which reports its limit and never its contents.
///   A number that cannot be read is better left off the screen than guessed at.
///
/// `CachedDataTests` walks the sources for every `URLCache(… diskPath:)` and fails if one is not
/// named in this file. A cache added later and wired into neither would make both the figure and
/// the button quietly wrong, which is the failure this screen exists to rule out.
